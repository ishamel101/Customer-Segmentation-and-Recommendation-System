# Customer segmentation and Recommendation system

In this project, we delve into the flourishing sector of online retail by analyzing a dataset of transactional records from a UK-based retailer, available in the UCI Machine Learning repository. This dataset documents all transactions between 2010 and 2011. Our primary objective is to enhance the effectiveness of marketing strategies and increase sales through customer segmentation. We aim to transform the transactional data into a customer-centric dataset by creating new features that will facilitate customer segmentation into distinct groups using the K-means clustering algorithm. This segmentation will enable us to understand the unique profiles and preferences of different customer groups. Building upon this, we intend to develop a recommendation system that will suggest the best-selling products to customers in each segment who have not yet purchased these items, thereby improving marketing efficiency and fostering an increase in sales.
